			<p>This website is my first use of the blogging platform Jekyll. I’d considered developing a personal site for some time. Despite extensive experience with Wordpress, its days of being a simple blog platform have long gone. I wanted something like Medium, but self hosted, simple to post to, and a little more customisable.</p>
			<br />
			<p>I had read about Jekyll some time back, the database-less-ness, markdown article styling, and native github host-deploy-publish aspect hooked my attention. So after some marginally painful command line battles with Ruby and Bundle, I had a test site compiling and publishing. I grabbed a simple but effective theme, gave it some custom bling, and here we are.</p>
			<br />
			<p>If you are comfortable with terminal commands and git deployments, it’s a really pleasant way to develop a site. Everything is logically structured and the templating is a lot like twig.</p>
